## habboRedirects
This is a really simple HTML and JS document which I use to open common sites in my Habbo Firefox container.

Containers are a bit like profiles, but typically all exist in the same window. This way I can use separate accounts for, say, my Habbo GDrive and YT Music.

This repo is hosted at [habboredirects.pages.dev](https://habboredirects.pages.dev/) by Cloudflare Pages (you could use any hosting solution), deployed using the Cloudflare Pages GitHub action.

This document is available under the Unlicense, for obvious reasons.
